Run
--------------
Open git bash, then run:

```console
sh start_vivado.sh
```

Files
--------------    
- top_111.tcl: Generated from a vivado project for which we want to save a snapshot on github for version control.
- All remaining files are files that will be referneced by the vivado project. Don't change their locations relative to top_111.tcl, otherwise the process of re-creating the vivado project might fail.
